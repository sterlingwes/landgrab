{"Id":"22015875","MlsNumber":"K20003370","PublicRemarks":"This exceptional parcel of land in Flinton (about 174.32 acres per MPAC) has so much to offer! The land is divided into two sections both of which have frontage on year round 5th Concession Rd. along with hydro service, but also on the O'Donnell Rd., which is unmaintained.  For the water lovers, the smaller portion on the northern side of the O'Donnell Rd features a meandering Skootamatta River that winds through this entire section and touches the road in a couple of places. For the hikers, hunters and hermits, the large section south of the O'Donnell Rd.  features acres of mature woods and trails.  There are sand and gravel pits on both sections, unlicensed and no longer in use. A new owner is free to obtain a standard building permit from the Township of Addington Highlands but if severances/development were contemplated, the Official Plan would come into play and certain restrictions would apply, eg., building setbacks from aggregate areas, for example.   But anyway, you slice it, this is an exciting piece of land with easy access, a navigable waterway and ultimate privacy!

{"Id":"22089199","MlsNumber":"K20003839","PublicRemarks":"Welcome to 1440 County Road 8, \"a blend of the past and present\". This 5 bedroom, 2-storey century home with 2 baths sits on a corner lot between Kingston and Smiths Falls in the Hamlet of Chantry. As you park you will be amazed at the full width covered porch at the back of the house looking out over the lovely treed back yard. Now let's enter into the large eat - in kitchen with plenty of counter space and cabinetry. The separate dining room is tastefully decorated and great for those special family /entertaining occasions. Original/restored woodwork highlight almost every room. Enjoy some quiet time in the living room or live it up in the family room, there is plenty of space to accommodate pretty much all that your family desires. There is a 20 x 20 workshop on the main level that could be used as additional living space if required but it sure is great for the handyman. Upstairs we go to 5 bedrooms, an office area and additional space. The spacious 17 x 14 master bedroom with a 13 x 7 walk-in closet, original wood floors and trim offers a feeling of content at the end of the day. The four other bedrooms are spacious as well and the bath with claw foot tub is a great way to relax after a long day. The single car detached steel sided/roof garage (formerly the Chantry Firehall) has power. This is a great home for a growing family. An easy commute to larger centers yet providing your own personal space in these unprecedented times. This home can't be overlooked.
