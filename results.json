{"Id":"22100079","MlsNumber":"273847","PublicRemarks":"An oasis of about 5.8 acres of picturesque vacant property with some cleared area, some forested with beautiful big trees and low rich greenery and to top it off your own pond! There is lots of wildlife sighting potential here. With frontages on both Pierce Road and Highway 62 there is just so much land to love and enjoy in different ways! The perfect central Prince Edward County location...minutes from the wineries and villages that everyone raves about. Easy access to the main highways to the city but at the same time a wonderful rural hideaway. A lovely spot to build your dream home or cottage. Natural gas and hydro right at the lot line which is a very rare and valuable bonus! More photos and video coming soon!
