{"Id":"22045070","MlsNumber":"K20003575","PublicRemarks":"Absolutely gorgeous property. Almost 3.5 acre parcel of beautiful land five minutes from downtown Hastings. All municipal services are available. Originally established as an estate setting, this fully surveyed parcel is located less than less ten minute from Trent- Severn Waterway. Power and telephone are available at roadside for any future building considerations. Entrance already in place. Topographically, the terrain is quite level and has a variety of trees. There are a number of homes in the area, however, it remains a quiet, relaxing setting.

This 5 bedroom, 2-storey century home with 2 baths sits on a corner lot between Kingston and Smiths Falls in the Hamlet of Chantry. As you park you will be amazed at the full width covered porch at the back of the house looking out over the lovely treed back yard. Now let's enter into the large eat - in kitchen with plenty of counter space and cabinetry. The separate dining room is tastefully decorated and great for those special family /entertaining occasions. Original/restored woodwork highlight almost every room. Enjoy some quiet time in the living room or live it up in the family room, there is plenty of space to accommodate pretty much all that your family desires. There is a 20 x 20 workshop on the main level that could be used as additional living space if required but it sure is great for the handyman. Upstairs we go to 5 bedrooms, an office area and additional space. The spacious 17 x 14 master bedroom with a 13 x 7 walk-in closet, original wood floors and trim offers a feeling of content at the end of the day. The four other bedrooms are spacious as well and the bath with claw foot tub is a great way to relax after a long day. The single car detached steel sided/roof garage (formerly the Chantry Firehall) has power. This is a great home for a growing family. An easy commute to larger centers yet providing your own personal space in these unprecedented times. This home can't be overlooked.

{"Id":"22208555","MlsNumber":"279971","PublicRemarks":"Year-round level accessible building lot on desirable Bay Lake Road. Not much more than 10 minutes into the town of Bancroft. Pie shaped lot with a driveway in place and a cleared area to build. There's an older concrete slab on the property that used to have a quonset hut on it. This slab could be quite useful for another quonset hut or maybe a garage or perch a tiny home on it. The slab likely needs to be inspected but it is there as a starter. Bonus piece is the lot is adjacent to a 66 ft road allowance that provides access to Lucerne Lake. Not on the water or waterfront taxes, but along the north boundary of the property is a road allowance directly to the shoreline.
