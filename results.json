{"Id":"20492251","MlsNumber":"184567","PublicRemarks":"Newly created 5 acre building lot on Williamsport Road. Truly a unique construction opportunity, with a picturesque trout stream meandering through the front of the lot. Once your across the stream the lot gently rises to a beautiful building site that gives a fantastic view of the surrounding forest. If you have some vision this could be the perfect property for you. This property would be great for a year around home or weekend retreat with snowmobile trails and areas to ATV just down the road. All this, and less then 15 minutes from downtown.* Please note the severance has been approved and the survey has been registered, and the PIN number will change once the new deed has been registered. Development fees will apply when  he buyer applies for their building permit.

There is lots of wildlife sighting potential here. With frontages on both Pierce Road and Highway 62 there is just so much land to love and enjoy in different ways! The perfect central Prince Edward County location...minutes from the wineries and villages that everyone raves about. Easy access to the main highways to the city but at the same time a wonderful rural hideaway. A lovely spot to build your dream home or cottage. Natural gas and hydro right at the lot line which is a very rare and valuable bonus! More photos and video coming soon!
