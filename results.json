{"Id":"21926887","MlsNumber":"263209","PublicRemarks":"This country home, surrounded by nature, is less than 10 minutes to the centre of Huntsville (Main St. at the bridge/Brunel). Open concept main floor with lots of natural light and woodstove gives an airy and cozy feel. Large wrap around deck provides even more living space. Gently rolling and cleared level areas of varied trees and wildlife on this acre and a1/2. This charming place has some quirks and needs some mending, but it is more than comfortable to live in, as-is, or remodel to make it your dream home.

There is lots of wildlife sighting potential here. With frontages on both Pierce Road and Highway 62 there is just so much land to love and enjoy in different ways! The perfect central Prince Edward County location...minutes from the wineries and villages that everyone raves about. Easy access to the main highways to the city but at the same time a wonderful rural hideaway. A lovely spot to build your dream home or cottage. Natural gas and hydro right at the lot line which is a very rare and valuable bonus! More photos and video coming soon!
