Where else on the Rideau System can you purchase  your own private island with accomodations for this price? Beautiful Indian Lake is located just north of Chaffeys  Lockes and the Opinicon Resort. Guard Island is the last island before the transition to Clear Lake.  This beautiful little island comes complete with a 1985 36 foot houseboat as your home away from home.  Bunkbed, full kitchen with dinette that converts to a sleeper, futon and bathroom.  There are front and back decks and ladder to upper deck. Approximately 7 year old 50 hp outboard motor.  Low Maintenance and minimal taxes make this an easy get away.  Local marinas are close by and make it an easy commute to island. Houseboat has lake intake water and holding tank, water heater and refridgerator run on propane. Purchase now for the opportunity to navigate through lockes in spring. (May long weekend) before the rush. Will include passes for the two Lockes.
