{"Id":"21926887","MlsNumber":"263209","PublicRemarks":"This country home, surrounded by nature, is less than 10 minutes to the centre of Huntsville (Main St. at the bridge/Brunel). Open concept main floor with lots of natural light and woodstove gives an airy and cozy feel. Large wrap around deck provides even more living space. Gently rolling and cleared level areas of varied trees and wildlife on this acre and a1/2. This charming place has some quirks and needs some mending, but it is more than comfortable to live in, as-is, or remodel to make it your dream home.

This lot is across from the entrance to George Street.   One of the pictures with the road sign if you look to the left you will see a monument with orange tape on it to give you some reference to where the lot starts.    Lot survey is available too.

This slab could be quite useful for another quonset hut or maybe a garage or perch a tiny home on it. The slab likely needs to be inspected but it is there as a starter. Bonus piece is the lot is adjacent to a 66 ft road allowance that provides access to Lucerne Lake.
