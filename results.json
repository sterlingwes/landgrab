{"Id":"21716573","MlsNumber":"251811","PublicRemarks":"King and Queen of the Castle!  This beautifully forested 2+ acre lot is perched at the top of the hill allowing for an incredible western exposure, natural breezes, privacy and even a ski in trail adjacent to the property for downhill skiing or biking at Sir Sam's ski and bike. The lot has a gentle rise at the front leveling out to a beautiful potential building spot about halfway up.  It's ideally located a short drive from the town of Eagle Lake which features a grocery store, deli, bakery, gas pumps, LCBO and more. There is also Eagle Lake public beach with a beautiful sandy beach and playground plus public boat launch.  At the bottom of the hill from the lot is Sir Sam's Inn and Waterspa featuring a pub and restaurant that can be open to the public.  Road fees pay for summer maintenance and winter plowing. This is a wonderful community of people and things to do or just enjoy the peacefulness and serenity. Plan on building your Castle here today!

{"Id":"21739435","MlsNumber":"253103","PublicRemarks":"Just outside the Village of Haliburton, you will find a lovely 50+ acre parcel, home to Moose (those footprints were BIG), deer, and a variety of forest animal friends. The acreage nestles up to a large pond, has a great mix of trees, evergreen, and hardwood, with many building sites to choose from, come and explore. An especially pretty spot overlooking a creek is a family favourite place to relax, listen to birdsong and breathe in the fresh Haliburton air! Fronting on a township year-round maintained road, hydro utilities at the lot line, access is easy. A ROW  runs through the property. In the busyness of todays world, wouldnt it be amazing to have this private piece of Haliburton land to build your country home or retreat?

This 17 acre property is lived in year round and is less than an hour north of Kingston, has a full septic system and drilled well on one lot and 2 other separate pie shaped lots about 5 acres each. A 2 bedroom 1 bathroom 17 year old Board and batten home with steel roof is built as a 3 season with woodstove (wett 3 yrs old) and wired for electric baseboard as heat. Have your morning coffee walking out to a 46' long deck (0 yrs old) to a well treed lot with some clearings, great for nature lovers, has a tree stand for hunters, and even has a sugar shack. Over 500' waterfrontage altogether, all lots have a gentle slope to the water. Great for fishing and small boating, not large boats on it for 30 years and rarely fished. 2 sheds. One one other home on the lake, across the road  from Bob's lake.  Needs lots of work, but wow great potential if you want complete seclusion.

{"Id":"22100079","MlsNumber":"273847","PublicRemarks":"An oasis of about 5.8 acres of picturesque vacant property with some cleared area, some forested with beautiful big trees and low rich greenery and to top it off your own pond! There is lots of wildlife sighting potential here. With frontages on both Pierce Road and Highway 62 there is just so much land to love and enjoy in different ways! The perfect central Prince Edward County location...minutes from the wineries and villages that everyone raves about. Easy access to the main highways to the city but at the same time a wonderful rural hideaway. A lovely spot to build your dream home or cottage. Natural gas and hydro right at the lot line which is a very rare and valuable bonus! More photos and video coming soon!
